# LanguageDetector

The task of language detection comes into use when you are working on a very large dataset that contains data in different languages. Suppose you want to create an even driven program where the final output depends on the language which the user provides as an input. So it is important to first detect the language of the text provided by the user before taking any action. So, I will take you through the task of language detection with Python.

If you have never used this package before then you can easily install it by using the pip command -  pip install langdetect.

#input: Enter any text in any language: Salut, je suis Aman Kharwal, j'espère que vous allez très bien.

#output: fr (French Language)

The output received is an abbreviated form of the language (fr means French). So the user can enter text in whatever language the user likes, your program will detect that language but it will give the short form of that language as output.
